[CSS-On-Diet](http://cofoh.com/css-on-diet) is a preprocessor for CSS files. The key feature are
mnemonics for frequently used properties and value names, which are similar to Emmet abbreviations.
Other goodies include media breakpoints, optional colons and semicolons, nested and one line
comments, variables and mixins, calculator, hexadecimal RGBA.

This task requires you to have [Python](https://www.python.org/download/)
and [CSS-On-Diet](http://cofoh.com/css-on-diet) installed. If you're on OS X or Linux you probably
already have Python installed; test with `python -V` in your terminal. When you've confirmed you have
Python installed, run `pip install CSSOnDiet` to install CSS-On-Diet.
